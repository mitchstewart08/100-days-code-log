## Round 1 started August 1st, 2020. Learn more at []()

### Day 1: Aug 1st. Saturday
**Today's Progress**: Did Leetcode's August Challenge Day 1. Day 1 of Javascript30 - Drum Machine to brush up on vanilla js skills

**Thoughts:** Excited for the journey ahead! Leetcode was easy but it's a Saturday so I don't mind ;)

### Day2: Aug 2nd. Sunday
**Today's Progress**: Did Leetcode's August Challenge Day 2. Front-end work. Next.js tutorial

**Thoughts:** Next.js is super cool, can't wait to use it on my next react project. Misinterpreted Leetcode's requirement, it passed but /shrug

### Day3: Aug 3rd. Monday
**Today's Progress**: Leetcode August3rd challenge. Front end work (mostly some css/styling), pair programmed on a greenfield React app to familarize myself with Redux Toolkit since I've been focused on Vue for so long.

### Day4: August 4th. Tuesday
**Today's Progress**: Leetcode August 4th challenge. Worked on an applescript to change my modifier keys (for when i have a PC keyboard plugged in) and swap back when i deactivate it. Ended up scrapping the project because Karabiner does it a lot easier.

### Day5: August 5th. Wedsnesday
**Today's Progress**: Leetcode August 5th Challenge. Got 96th percentile on speed/efficiency, with a O(n) solution. Started working on a bot for my discord server called Hoidbot (might just use webhook functionality instead, need to research tommorow)

### Day6: August 6th. Thursday
**Today's Progress**: Leetcode August 6th Challenge. Futz with webhooks and bots today, got my ifttt working at least

### Day7: August 7th. Friday
**Today's Progress**: Didn't do leetcode today, still feeling the effects of Ketoflu. Got hoid bot working successfully with GET requests to covid api

### Day8: August 8th. Saturday
**Today's Progress**: Python is weird after using JS for so long. Spent 1.7 hours today trying to get the successful data from GET requests to output to the server on command. Doesn't help most python docs suppose you are using Requests.

**Day 9: August 9th. Sunday**
decided to brush up on my python with Automate The Boring Stuff, worked on my covid discord bot to output more data.

### Day 10: August 10th. Monday
**Today's Progress**:: Coded a python script to take my pbcopy, transform it with upper() then paste the result, had to futz with $PATH to get Keyboard Maestro to work correctly, figured out I could just use a regex pattern instead so went with that. Did toy problem (find_meetings) on interview cake.
